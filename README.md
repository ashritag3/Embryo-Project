# 🧬 **LetoHealth**

### **AI-Assisted Embryo Evaluation for IVF Decision Support**

---

## 🌱 **Overview**

**LetoHealth** is an artificial intelligence–powered decision-support tool designed to assist embryologists during the embryo selection process in **in vitro fertilization (IVF)**. Rather than replacing clinical expertise, LetoHealth functions as a **second opinion**, helping reduce subjectivity, minimize diagnostic error, and support more informed embryo transfer decisions.

Embryo assessment is a high-stakes process—small misjudgments can lead to failed implantation or miscarriage. **LetoHealth aims to reduce these risks** by enabling cross-checking between human evaluation and AI-based analysis.

## ❓ **Why LetoHealth?**

Embryo grading is traditionally performed through visual inspection, which can vary across embryologists and clinics. **LetoHealth addresses this challenge by:**

- Providing a **consistent, objective AI-based evaluation**
- Acting as a **verification layer** for embryologists’ initial assessments
- Supporting **reevaluation** when AI and human conclusions diverge
- Helping reduce the likelihood of **life-altering diagnostic mistakes**

If discrepancies arise between **LetoHealth’s analysis** and a clinician’s judgment, embryologists are prompted to reassess and reanalyze the embryo—potentially improving IVF outcomes.

## 🧠 **How It Works**

1. **Embryo Imaging Input**  
   High-resolution embryo images are provided to the system.

2. **AI Analysis**  
   A trained deep-learning model evaluates embryo quality based on morphological features and developmental indicators.

3. **Comparison & Feedback**  
   The AI’s evaluation is compared with the embryologist’s assessment.

4. **Decision Support**  
   In cases of disagreement, clinicians are encouraged to reevaluate before making final transfer decisions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** LetoHealth is designed for **clinical decision support only** and does **not** replace licensed medical professionals.
